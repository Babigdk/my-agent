# Project Rules

1.  **Tool Definitions:** All new tools should be defined in the `tools.ts` file.
2.  **Function Signatures:** All tool functions should be `async` and return a `Promise`.
3.  **Error Handling:** All tool functions should have robust error handling to prevent the application from crashing.
4.  **Input Validation:** All tool functions should validate their input to prevent security vulnerabilities.
5.  **Code Comments:** All new code should be well-commented to explain its purpose and functionality.
